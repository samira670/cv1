<p> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashikadnan/railway-track-fault-detection-dataset2fastener" > In this code the dataset from Kaggle is used.</a> #The dataset contains defective and non-defective images related to railway tracks. 

  This code involves training a DeiT (Data-efficient image Transformer) model for image classification using k-fold cross-validation. It begins by preparing the dataset, employing transformations, and splitting it into training, validation, and test sets. The DeiT model is configured, with modifications to its classifier, and training parameters are set. The k-fold cross-validation loop iteratively trains the model on different folds of the training set and evaluates its performance. Key metrics, including loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are calculated and averaged across folds. The results are then visualized over epochs, offering insights into the model's learning dynamics and effectiveness.</p>
