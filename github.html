<p> In this code the dataset from kaggle was used.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) #The dataset is contain a number of cases that come to hospital and based on their situation they sent to different sections #So we used preprocessing method we get rid off unnecessary data #and then our data frame would be based on two parameters symptoms of the sick people person and sections #So we trained some with some neural algorithmusing using tensorflow , And find the accuracy in prediction</p>

      <li>  <a href="https://github.com/samira670/Eclat-Algorithm">Eclat-Algorithm_using_python_for_recognizing_frequent_dataset</a> </li>

<p>The ECLAT (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal) algorithm is used to identify frequent item sets in transactional data. The Eclat algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm for frequent itemset mining.

It works by generating all possible itemset combinations and counting their support in the dataset.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search approach to generate all possible combinations of itemsets.

The Eclat algorithm can be faster than Apriori for datasets with a small number of items and a large number of transactions.</p>

      <h3>Some examples of code in C#
      </h3>    
    <li> <a href = https://github.com/samira670/HospitalSystem>Hospital System </a> </li>
    <p> The main objective of this project is to develop a small application with a graphical user interface that will allow us to use the machine learning algorithm. To achieve this objective, we have the following specific goals:

Create different windows with specific functionalities such as a login interface for doctors, a window to create a new doctor's profile, a main window containing various functionalities, and a window to create and modify a patient's profile. Use the MVVM software architecture model to ensure that the application is efficient and user-friendly. Establish communication with a database using Entity Framework Core. Use KnnLibrary to implement the k-NN algorithm and measure the model's performance. Ensure that the application is user-friendly and that the different components are properly arranged and validated. By achieving these objectives, we will develop a small application that will allow us to use the machine learning algorithm developed in the context of the second practical work. The application will be efficient, easy to use, and user-friendly. Furthermore, we will demonstrate our ability to use different technologies and design patterns to develop software applications with a graphical user interface.</p>
