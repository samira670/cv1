      <li>   <a href="https://github.com/samira126/text_classification_ML-algorithms">Text classification using Ml algorthms</a>
      <p>Text Classification with ML algorithms : MLP, LogisticRegression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest.In this code the dataset from kaggle was used.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) #The dataset is contain a number of cases that come to hospital and based on their situation they sent to different sections #So we used preprocessing method we get rid off unnecessary data #and then our data frame woeld be based on two parameters symptoms of the sick people person and sections #So we trained some with some ML algorithms : MLP, LogisticRegression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, And find their accuracy in prediction</p> </li>

<p>In this code the dataset from kaggle was used.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) #The dataset is contain a number of description about different courses and our classes are 4 courses #So we used preprocessing method we get rid off unnecessary data #and then our data frame would be based on two parameters description of courses with necessary words and courses #So the model was trained with Bert transformer algorithm pytorch , And find the accuracy in prediction</p>
