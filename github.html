            <p>Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wolfmedal/aero-engine-defect-new/data">Dataset</a>. This project develops a machine learning model to classify aero-engine defects by utilizing a pre-trained DeiT model for feature extraction, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and an ensemble of Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers. The process includes downloading and preparing the dataset, extracting image features with the DeiT model, and visualizing these features using UMAP. The data is split into training and validation sets, with both classifiers being trained and combined into an ensemble model. The ensemble model is then evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and its predictions are interpreted with SHAP to visualize feature importance. Additionally, various functions are defined to visualize the top activations and images with bounding boxes based on SHAP values, providing a comprehensive understanding of the model's decision-making process.</li>

            <p>This Python script utilizes the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn to classify iris species based on the Iris dataset. The script begins by loading the data and converting it into a Pandas DataFrame for manipulation, followed by checking for any missing values. It then splits the dataset into training and testing sets, uses the RandomForestClassifier to train on the training data, and finally evaluates the model's performance on the test data using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. This evaluation helps verify the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/samira670/stroke-prediction/tree/main">Stroke Prediction</a>
            <p>In the stroke prediction project hosted on GitHub, a variety of machine learning models were employed to predict the likelihood of strokes based on health-related data from individuals. The dataset used includes numerous parameters such as age, gender, hypertension status, and smoking habits, which are integral to assessing stroke risk. Among the models tested, which include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, the Random Forest classifier emerged as the most effective. It achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99%, along with precision and recall, making it the best model for this particular dataset. This superior performance can be attributed to Random Forest's ability to handle imbalanced datasets and its robustness against overfitting, proving it to be an invaluable tool in the predictive analysis of medical conditions.</p>
